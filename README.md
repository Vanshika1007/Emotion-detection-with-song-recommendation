# üéµ Emotion Detection with Song Recommendation

An AI-powered application that detects a user's emotion from their facial expression or text input and suggests personalized songs to match the mood.  
This project combines **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Music Recommendation Systems** to enhance the listening experience.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Input Emotion Source**  
   - Live camera captures user's face  
   - OR user enters text describing their mood

2. **Emotion Detection**  
   - **Facial Expression**: OpenCV detects face ‚Üí ML/DL model predicts emotion  
   - **Text Input**: NLP sentiment analysis determines emotion

3. **Song Recommendation**  
   - Matches detected emotion with pre-defined music dataset or queries Spotify API
   - Displays recommended songs/playlists

4. **Enjoy the Music!** üéß
